\item There's no sound output on BBB. The default audio device, as mentioned in
some foruns on the web, is through the HDMI connector. The same forum has said
that we can disable the HDMI as audio device by changing some kernel parameters,
then the second device would become the main one. In this case, the USB would be
the principal sound card. The easist way, then, would be attach an USB speaker
to the connector, because the TTS would automatically output the result to that
port. My point about the USB speaker:
\begin{itemize}
\item It must be low power consuming
\item Its size must be limited. If the project was to build a thermistor plugged
on the wall, we could not put a big speaker there. The circuit must be smaller
than the BBB itself.
\end{itemize}
It would be nice if we could build an amplifier and put the sinthesized audio  
through a BBB GPIO, but...
\begin{itemize}
\item I don't know how to manipulate the TTS output to put in that pin
\item Even If I could do that, It's hard to play a sound with PWM. A chunck of
audio, size dependent of the sampling rate, should be put in that GPIO in a slot
of time. And I think it's not as simple as this description.
\item The arduino codes I've found that play sound through a pin have the
craziest codes I've ever seen. Almost everything is manually done.
\item I think the output is gonna be terrible and polyphonic
\item The PCM2707 DAC is around 10 USD and will also need an amplifier circuit
with LM386
\end{itemize}

\item BBB não tem conexão wifi e é difícil atualizar o kernel pra receber um
shield/case. Além do mais, tal shield/case seria plugado na porta USB, a qual 
já estaria sendo usada pelo auto-falante. Portanto, a solução mais fácil foi
conectar um roteador wifi à porta Ethernet da BBB através de um cabo RJ45.
